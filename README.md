## Getting started with Selenium using JavaScript: Tutorial
Selenium offers great flexibility when it comes to testing. Whether it is platforms like Windows, Linux, Solaris, or the browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, IE, or Safari, Selenium allows platform-independent, cross-browser test functionality with no licensing costs. Here’s how to get started with the Automated UI testing of an application using Selenium WebDriver and JavaScript:

### Prerequisites of the Setup Configuration
1. Node.js (comes bundled with npm, i.e. Node package manager). For those comfortable with using Maven in Java, consider this to be the equivalent package manager for JS.
2. Any IDE to write the code. The example in this article uses Visual Studio Code. 

### Step 1: Install Node.js npm
One can download Node.js and npm, and then check that it is installed by running the following commands in the terminal.
(https://nodejs.org/en/download)

To check Node.js is installed
```
node -v
```
To check npm is installed
```
npm -v
```
Once the user has installed Node.js, they will get access to the npm, an inbuilt package manager which will be used to install Selenium for JS.

### Step 2: Install Selenium WebDriver
One can download Selenium WebDriver, and install it by running the following command in the terminal by using the Node’s built-in package manager (NPM) to get the package.
```
npm install --save selenium-webdriver
```
(–-save creates a new package. This would be saved to the project’s package.json file.)

### Step 3: Install Visual Studio Code

### Step 4: Install Selenium Webdriver and Client language bindings
Selenium WebDriver and client language bindings are important to establish a connection between the WebDriver and the client and perform testing. Here are the links to install the Selenium WebDriver and client language bindings:
